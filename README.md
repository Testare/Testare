Hello there!

I'm just a guy who discovered software development online while in 8th grade and primarily self-taught until college, driven by a love for software development and a desire to hone my skills in the profession I consider closest to actual magic.

As a professional, I'm driven to create and polish software so that it is a joy to code, maintain, understand, and use. I also pretty much always have at least one side-project motivated by a desire to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-woodbury-2b1b0364/), or ask me for a resume for more details on my experience and skills.

*(I use Arch btw)*
